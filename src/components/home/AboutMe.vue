    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a computer science student at the University of Sasaktchewan, currently completing a 16 month internship
      at Vendasta Technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love all things computer science, but my current passion is web development (both front and back-end).
      That said, I am always open to trying new things and learning new technologies whenever I have the chance.
